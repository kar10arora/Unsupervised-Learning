Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, to analyze and segment Facebook status updates.
By leveraging a dataset of status types, the project uncovers patterns and groupings among similar status updates, offering valuable insights into user behavior
and preferences on social media platforms.

Features
K-means Clustering: Segment status updates into distinct clusters based on content similarities.
Hierarchical Clustering: Visualize the relationships between different clusters to understand content hierarchies.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset, including handling missing values and tokenization.
Visualizations: Generate plots and graphs to illustrate clustering results and trends.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Tokenize and vectorize the status texts using appropriate methods (e.g., TF-IDF).
K-means Clustering:
Apply the K-means algorithm to segment status updates, determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
Hierarchical Clustering:
Implement hierarchical clustering to analyze the relationships among status types, visualizing results with
dendrograms to illustrate cluster formations.
